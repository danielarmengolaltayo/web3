**Sleep disorder, 2016** <sup>[<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/danielarmengolaltayo/sets/72157672858583473" target="_blank">gallery</a>]</sup>

Both smartphones watched by a small robot. The first one has the alarm set. When it sounds, a mechanism touches the screen to snooze it. The second has the screen on, and each time the brightness goes down (anticipating the locking of the device), a mechanism touches the screen to prevent it from entering into sleep mode.

Machines becoming more and more human and increasingly mechanical individuals. Two gestures repeated non-stop, in a monotonous and predictable dance.

Who awakens whom? Who represses the sleep of whom?

Habits and automata. Roles mixed up.
