I worked designing physical interactive installations <sup>[<a href="invaders.html">Invaders</a>, 2008]</sup> that attracted people to congregate in a specific moment and place, to collectively experiment with new ways to relate to each other <sup>[<a href="simon.html">Simon</a>, 2013]</sup>, looking for experiences that encourage people to create meaningful connections <sup>[<a href="businesscards.html">business cards</a>]</sup>.

From design, I gradually moved into artistic practice. I built robots to exhibit our ease to assimilate new gestures and rapidly automate them <sup>[<a href="artificialselfie.html">#artificialselfie</a>, 2016]</sup>, on purpose <sup>[<a href="somethingiswrong.html">Something is wrong</a>, 2017]</sup> or without being completely aware of it <sup>[<a href="sleepdisorder.html">Sleep disorder</a>, 2016]</sup>. I even surrendered control of my own gestures to others in order to stage the power of digital devices as behavioral design tools <sup>[<a href="follow.html">Follow</a>, 2018]</sup>.
