Sometimes, after meeting a person for the first time, we perform a ritual of exchanging contact details in order to formalize the new relationship. I used this moment and my business card as an excuse to explain more about my activity, about creating meaningful connections between people. That is why I decided to use business cards from others I met before with my email stuck on them.

In this way, I was not only sharing my contact, but the means to contact another person who I would carefully choose from my deck, looking together with my new acquaintance for common points of interest or ways in which they could complement each other.
