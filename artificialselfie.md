A selfie is a paradigmatic way to prove to the contemporary world that one exists. The machine expresses this need by taking selfies of itself and sharing them on Instagram.

The piece, performing tireless the same action over and over again, questions our relationship with technology. On one hand, we teach machines to understand us, giving them the ability to replicate gestures and habits in a surprisingly human way. On the other hand, as we all seem to repeat the same behaviors with a given technology, we ourselves start acting as predictable machines.
