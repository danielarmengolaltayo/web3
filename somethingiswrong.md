**Something is wrong, 2017**

September 20, 2017. Spanish police stormed Catalan government buildings in an attempt to stop the independence referendum <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum" target="_blank">wiki</a>]</sup>.

At 10:00 pm, a *cacerolada* <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacerolazo" target="_blank">wiki</a>]</sup>, a form of popular protest which consists of a group of people making noise by banging pots, pans, and other utensils in order to call for attention, started in multiple municipalities across Catalunya.

The *cacerolada* repeated every day at the same hour to support the referendum that took place on October 1.
