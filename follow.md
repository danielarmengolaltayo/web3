We live together in a beautiful but unbalanced world, where the fears and interests of some, design the behaviours of many.

This relationship of power applies in any social interaction; we are constantly being influenced by the thoughts and actions of the others, and viceversa, molding the persona, hence the entire social fabric. Sometimes this happens in a natural manner, free of intention, sometimes there is a hidden agenda behind, and not always is easy to identify who controls who.

Are you able to recognize the tools and strategies used to create, modify or determinate behaviour? Do you act responsibly when using them on another human being?
